				<p class="main-text">Bicep was formed in 2009 as a production and DJing pair in London, UK. The duo, childhood friends,[3] created a blog called "Feel My Bicep", which was used to post lost and forgotten disco, Chicago house, Detroit techno and Italo disco edits.[4][5]
				They released tracks on labels Throne of Blood, Traveller Records and Mystery Meat before joining Will Saul's Aus Music and setting up their own label Feel My Bicep in September 2012.[6][7] That year the pair were awarded DJ Mag's 'Best of British Breakthrough DJ' award.[8]
